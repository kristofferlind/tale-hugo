# Tale

This theme was designed by Chester How, ported to hugo by Emiel Hollander. This fork includes some restructuring to work the way I want it to and some performance improvements.

Demo (/exampleSite): (https://www.lind.sh/tale-hugo/)

## Installation

### 1. Install the theme

If your site is also under version control using git, the easiest way to install this theme is to add it as a submodule. If you have not created a git repo for your project yet, you need to run `git init` beforehand. Inside the folder of your Hugo site, run the following command.

```
git submodule add https://github.com/kristofferlind/tale-hugo.git themes/tale
```

Alternatively, you can clone the theme into your project.

```
git clone https://github.com/kristofferlind/tale-hugo.git themes/tale
```

### 2. Configure Hugo

Add the following line to `config.toml` to tell Hugo to use the theme.

```
theme = "tale"
```

## Example
Check /exampleSite for example of content structure
